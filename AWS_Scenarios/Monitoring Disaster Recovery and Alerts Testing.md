### **Step 7: Monitoring Disaster Recovery and Alerts Testing**

Monitoring disaster recovery processes and testing the alerting setup ensures your infrastructure is resilient and that you're notified of any issues in real time.

#### **Exercise 4: Monitor Multi-Region Failover**

1. **Use Blackbox Exporter for HTTP Health Checks**:
   - Deploy a Blackbox Exporter in your monitoring cluster.
   - Configure it to monitor the health of services deployed in multiple regions.
   - Example `blackbox.yml` configuration:
     ```yaml
     modules:
       http_2xx:
         prober: http
         timeout: 5s
         http:
           valid_http_versions: [ "HTTP/1.1", "HTTP/2" ]
           fail_if_ssl: false
           fail_if_not_ssl: false
     ```
   - Add this to your Prometheus configuration:
     ```yaml
     scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'blackbox'
       metrics_path: /probe
       params:
         module: [http_2xx]
       static_configs:
         - targets:
           - http://nginx-east.example.com
           - http://nginx-west.example.com
       relabel_configs:
         - source_labels: [__address__]
           target_label: __param_target
         - source_labels: [__param_target]
           target_label: instance
         - target_label: __address__
           replacement: blackbox-exporter:9115
     ```

2. **Set Up Alerts for Failover**:
   - Create Prometheus alert rules for service downtime.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     groups:
     - name: FailoverAlerts
       rules:
       - alert: RegionDown
         expr: probe_success{instance="nginx-east.example.com"} == 0
         for: 5m
         labels:
           severity: critical
         annotations:
           summary: "Region {{ $labels.instance }} is down"
           description: "The service in region {{ $labels.instance }} is unreachable. Initiate failover checks."
     ```

3. **Visualize in Grafana**:
   - Create a dashboard with:
     - `probe_success` for service health.
     - Response times for both regions.
     - Alert notifications for failover.

#### **Exercise 5: Test Alerts**

1. **Simulate Backup Failures**:
   - Stop your backup script and verify that the `BackupFailed` alert triggers.
   - Resume the backup and ensure the alert resolves.

2. **Simulate Service Failover**:
   - Manually stop the Nginx service in the primary region:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop nginx
     ```
   - Verify that alerts are sent and traffic is redirected to the secondary region.

3. **Test Alert Notification Channels**:
   - Ensure email, Slack, or webhook notifications are working.
   - Use tools like PagerDuty or Opsgenie for incident management.

### **Step 8: Automating Disaster Recovery Validation**

Create a pipeline to periodically validate your disaster recovery setup.

1. **Validation Pipeline Steps**:
   - Step 1: Verify backups by restoring to a test environment.
   - Step 2: Perform failover tests by simulating region downtime.
   - Step 3: Check alerts and ensure notification channels are functional.

2. **Example Jenkins Pipeline**:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Backup Validation') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mysql -u root -p my_test_db < /backups/my_database-latest.sql'
               }
           }
           stage('Failover Simulation') {
               steps {
                   sh 'aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0abcd1234efgh5678'
               }
           }
           stage('Alert Testing') {
               steps {
                   sh 'curl -X POST http://alertmanager:9093/api/v1/alerts -d @test-alert.json'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### **Summary of Progress So Far**

By completing these exercises, you now have:
1. A multi-region deployment with failover capabilities.
2. Configured monitoring for disaster recovery processes.
3. Alerting systems that notify you of issues in real time.
4. Automated disaster recovery validation.
